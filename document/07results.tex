\section{Evaluation metrics}
In the process of evaluation, we used mean per joint position error (MPJPE) and mean average precision (mAP) as metrics, following~\cite{Ali19,haque2016viewpoint,Marin18jvcir,Shafaei16}. Mean average precision is defined as percentage of all skeletal joints predicted under $10 \; \mbox{cm}$ threshold from their ground truth position.

\section{Experiments}

% MHAD - During visual inspection of Berkely MHAD
%we noticed that on some frames, especially when the subject
%bends over, the location of the hands is outside of the body
%point cloud or even outside the frame, and clearly erroneous.
%The overall average precision at 10 cm is 93%.

% CMU - mention that there is no documentation of any pose estimation results on this dataset so far, up to our knowledge

% TODO our proposed model proved to benefit from the redundancy in the network inputs, being able to absorb the local and global context at once. - mozno az v conclusion ?
